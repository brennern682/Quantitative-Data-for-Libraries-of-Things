Project Title: Finding Data in Libraries of Things

Project Status: Complete

Project Team: Nick Brenner, Yuan Sciscent

Project Description

This project created a quantitative dataset collecting the holdings of 14 libraries of things (LoT) in the tri-state area of New York City (NY, NJ, CT). It records types of items held in LoT and categories applied by different libraries in organizing holdings, and rural/urban classifications of the communities in which LoTs are situated, according to the US Department of Agriculture's Rural Classification metrics. 

All project files are labelled: [filename]_LoT_DL2025

I. How to Use the Spreadsheets

This spreadsheet compiles all the data related to the 14 LoTs surveyed in this project. It contains three different types of spreadsheets.

A. Spreadsheet #1: 
File Name: Sample-Size-Population-Statistics_LoT_DL2025.csv

The first spreadsheet, titled “List of Libraries,” provides an overview of the libraries surveyed by the LoT, organized by location. This information includes the name of the library, the community in which it is located, its state, and whether the community is classified as rural, urban, or suburban, according to USDA Rural Classification metrics. The data visualization was created using Tableau Public 

B. Spreadsheet #2: 
File Name: Category-Comparison_LoT_DL2025 - Category-Comparison_LoT_DL2025.csv 

The second spreadsheet, called “Categories Comparison”, contains the breakdown of categories in the surveyed LoTs. It lists each LoT, the categories used to organize the LoT, and the quantity of items in each category. The bottom of the spreadsheet synthesizes this information into a comparison of the total number of items in different categories across LoTs. The unique categories used by LoTs are condensed into 9 general categories, following the definitions outlined in the Glossary of Terms. The full breakdown of how the categories were combined is outlined below:

The third category of spreadsheet contains information about collection holdings at each LoT. There are 14 of these sheets in total, one for each LoT surveyed. Each sheet records the name and state of each LoT, a link to the collection webpage for the LoT, and a list of each item in the LoT, organized by the category in which the library places them.

III. Glossary of Terms
Since there is no standardized definition for terms in LoT among all the sample libraries, the researchers designed a glossary of terms to help provide clarity for the purposes of this project. The categorization of items may not be entirely accurate, as some items can fall under multiple categories, which can lead to ambiguity. 

Library of Things (LoT) – is a material in a traditional library’s collection that is not a book, serial, periodical, audiobook, video, or information format that provides a wealth of knowledge through the act of reading, listening, or watching (Robison, 2017). Although there may be variants of this name, for the purposes of this project, researchers will refer to any form of alternative lending or borrowing in a library as the Library of Things. 

Art & Crafts – a common category in LoT that relates to items that aid in the creation of art which also include, but are not limited to: instruments, fiber arts, crafts, jewelry, print design, and painting. 

Electronics/Technology/Audiovisual – while often found in separate categories among different libraries, the delineation between electronics and audiovisual is hard to define and thus have been clustered as one category for this project as it relates to items that require electric power to operate. 

Games (Video Games, Board Games, & Puzzles) – This is a general title for items that fall under the categories: video games, board games, and puzzles/jigsaw puzzles. These are items primarily used indoors. See Outdoor and Recreation for lawn games. 

Health & Wellness – a category that relates to items that promote physical, mental, or emotional wellbeing. Some items in this category include crutches, therapy lamps, yoga mat, and sensory kits.   

Kids & Early Literacy – a category seen across multiple LoT covering materials designed specifically for children’s leisure and education on non-STEM topics. This category often takes the form of “kits”, children’s toys, and literacy-building items like children’s books or specially-designed toys.

Outdoor & Recreation – a category with items that are used outdoors. While this is not a label used in libraries, for the purposes of this project, it will refer to names of categories such as: lawn games, yard games, recreation, outdoors, garden, adventure, and museum passes.

STEM & Science – a category with items that relates to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics which predominantly caters to children and teenagers. This is separate from Kids/Early Literacy as it is this specific title many libraries use in their LoT collection.  

Tools & Repairs – a category that includes equipment and devices used for basic maintenance, repairs, and common tasks. 

Household & Kitchen – this category is a combination of two separate categories, for the purposes of this project, it is clustered as one as a kitchen is a section of the household. This category relates to items you would find within your household.

C. Spreadsheet #3: Individual Library Spreadsheets
File Names: Library-Name-Collections_LoT_DL2025.csv

These spreadsheets cover the invidiual items held at each LoT surveyed in this project. It is organized by category, recording each item in a given category and the amount of that item the library possesses.
